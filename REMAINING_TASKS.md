## Branko owes (manual config, no Pablo input needed)

### Google Maps / Places

- ✅ Both API keys created + restricted (Android `Cromos26KeyAndroid`, iOS `Cromos26KeyiOS`)
- ✅ Keys wired into `apps/mobile/eas.json` + `apps/mobile/.env.local`
- ✅ Address autocomplete component built (`AddressForm`)
- ⏳ Add **Play App Signing SHA-1** to Android key restriction (after first AAB upload to Play Console)
- ⏳ Rotate keys before public launch (current keys exposed in our chat)

### Mercado Pago

- ✅ Code path ready (`/api/payments/mp/preference` → live when env vars set, falls back to STUB)
- ⏳ **Paste TEST credentials into Render env:**
  ```
  MP_ACCESS_TOKEN_TEST   = APP_USR-8297526384109437-052000-...
  MP_PUBLIC_KEY_TEST     = APP_USR-be0ae120-6434-...
  MP_WEBHOOK_SECRET      = 0d7aba4595715d0829e7986f...
  ```
- ⏳ Temporarily unset `MP_ACCESS_TOKEN_PROD` to force TEST mode during QA
- ⏳ Curl-verify preference endpoint stops returning STUB
- ⏳ Pablo retries checkout end-to-end with TEST card (`5031 7557 3453 0604`, CVV `123`, future date)

### Play Store

- ⏳ Service account JSON for `eas submit --platform android` — can create ourselves using Pablo's Play Console password
- ⏳ Upload first AAB to Internal Testing track
- ⏳ Add testers + opt-in URL
- ⏳ Promote Internal → Closed → Open → Production after testing

### App Store

- ✅ Apple Team `7D7NLMWLYL` (Pablo's account) confirmed
- ✅ TestFlight build #7 submitted earlier
- ⏳ Confirm #7 status is "Ready to Test" (Pablo)
- ⏳ Add Internal Testing group + invite testers
- ⏳ Submit for App Review (1-2 day turnaround)

### Domain

- ⏳ Buy `zonamundial.mx` (Branko handles, registers under Pablo's profile if requested)
- ⏳ Point DNS to Vercel (landing) + Render (API)
- ⏳ Update share text + referral URLs in code

### Production data

- ⏳ Add real product images for 5 missing SKUs (Acrilico, Caja Repetidas Consigna, Carta Coca-Cola, Cartita suelta, Set Coca-Cola en sobre) — need photos from Pablo
- ⏳ Seed any new Star SKUs once Pablo confirms #10

### OAuth (when auth sprint starts)

- ⏳ Google OAuth Client IDs (Android + iOS + Web) in Google Cloud Console
- ⏳ Apple "Sign in with Apple" service ID + key in Apple Developer
- ⏳ Facebook App ID in Meta Developer Portal (only if Pablo picks option C)

## Code features still to build

After Pablo answers the questions, in this order:

### Auth sprint (~6 hrs, blocked on Q1)
- Welcome screen + sign-in/sign-up flow
- Provider buttons (Google / Apple / Facebook depending on Q1 answer)
- `expo-auth-session` config
- Link existing local album state to account (one-time merge)

### Backend remaining (~3 hrs)
- `/auth/signup` captures `?ref=` query param into `users.referredBy`
- `/referral/me` returns code + stats
- `/referral/credit` internal endpoint triggered by paid webhook
- MP webhook decrement on `payment.created` for Star SKUs (needs `star_player_stock` table)
- Pickup code generated server-side and persisted on order (instead of client-derived last-6)

### Stars inventory live (~2 hrs)
- Supabase `star_player_stock` table + migration
- Admin grid live-editable (currently read-only)
- CSV export

### Final pre-launch polish
- Replace placeholder product images
- Add Real player names where Pablo confirms
- Trademark disclaimer pass on every screen

- ✅ Checkout address split fields + Google Places autocomplete
- ✅ Mobile UI translated to English
- ✅ Admin Stars inventory page (read-only)
- ✅ Real product images for 7 main SKUs
- ✅ Landing page at `https://zona-mundial.vercel.app/`
